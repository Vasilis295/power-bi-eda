>This Data set contains the information related red wine , Various factors affecting the quality. This data set was prepossessed and downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data set was simple, cleaned, practice data set for classification modelling. Source of this Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Attribute Information:

6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality ('good' and 'bad' based on score >5 and <5)
